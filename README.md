# CPU-Scheduling-With-Dynamic-Time-Allocation-and-Predict-Burst-Time-Using-ML
Scheduling is the central concept used in Operating Systems. It helps in choosing the 
processes for execution in an efficient sequence. Round Robin (RR) is one of the most 
commonly used CPU scheduling algorithms. But there is a degradation of performance 
with respect to context switching, which is an overhead cost to the system. The performance 
of a system depends on the choice of an optimal time quantum, so as to reduce context 
switching. In this paper, we have proposed a new variant of Round Robin which is better 
than the traditional Round Robin scheduling by reducing context switching, average 
waiting time and average turnaround time
In Modified round robin algorithm, we can’t say any it has any limitations or drawback. But of 
course, we can’t deny the fact that context switching, average waiting time and average turnaround 
time can still be reduced. So, in coming future we are planning to reduce the context switching, 
average waiting time and average turnaround time even more. So that computer system will be 
more efficient
